FlavorHub Search Engine - MONOLITHIC SEARCH MODULE (1103 lines)

⚠️ CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DEBT ⚠️

This file has grown organically over 18 months from 150 lines to 1103 lines.
It embodies the "God Object" anti-pattern - doing everything related to search.

WHAT'S IN THIS FILE (everything!):
- Database connection management (hard-coded, no pooling)
- Query parsing (3 different versions, only one used)
- Input validation (none - accepts garbage)
- Filtering logic (5 filter functions + 3 deprecated versions)
- Dietary restriction handling (THE BUG: Line 447)
- Ranking algorithms (2 active, 3 commented-out experiments)
- A/B testing variants (feature flags everywhere)
- Response formatting (JSON, XML support half-implemented)
- Pagination (inefficient, loads everything in memory)
- Caching logic (broken, causes stale data - Issue #183)
- Metrics collection (manual counters, no aggregation)
- Error handling (inconsistent, swallows exceptions)
- Debug logging (print statements everywhere)
- Helper utilities (miscellaneous functions)

THE PRODUCTION BUG:
- LINE 447: filter_by_dietary() crashes when user.dietary_restrictions is None
- Affects 23% of users (those without dietary preferences)
- Causes: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
- Workaround: Frontend team hardcodes dietary_restrictions=[] (breaks API contract)

ARCHITECTURE SMELLS:
- 74 magic numbers (no constants)
- 12 feature flags (unclear which are active)
- Database connection created per request (no pooling)
- 3 versions of ranking algorithm (unclear which is production)
- Dead code from failed A/B tests (never removed)
- No separation of concerns (validation, business logic, persistence all mixed)
- 0% test coverage (too coupled to test)

TEAM NOTES:
- "TODO: Refactor this monster" (added 9 months ago)
- "FIXME: This is getting out of hand" (added 6 months ago)
- "HACK: Don't judge me" (appears 8 times)
- Last person who tried to refactor quit after 2 weeks

NEEDED (from @search-architect analysis):
1. Break into 4 modules: validation, filtering, aggregation, formatting
2. Add Pydantic validation layer
3. Fix null handling (Issue #447)
4. Extract database connection to connection pool
5. Remove dead code and obsolete experiments
6. Add comprehensive test coverage
7. Document which feature flags are active
8. Replace magic numbers with named constants

REFACTOR PLAN:
- Traditional approach: 3-4 days, high risk of regression
- With Spec Kit + Agents: 2 hours, governed by constitution, trackable specs
